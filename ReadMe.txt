Created by Thomas Smidt as an application project for twentyfour ApS

The job test can be found here:

Viewwidth's optimized for: 
1920px
1200px
768px
365px

Please consider that this is all self-taught in about 4 months, so it probably
isn't the cleanest code possible.

Known bugs: 
Pressing the mobile-menu and changing the viewwidth will make a button that is
supposed to be invisible in non-mobile view, be visible on screen, until refreshed.

The animation that occurs when hovering the links in the navbar only works when you 
hover the bottom-border of the text, this only occurs in the desktop-view.
